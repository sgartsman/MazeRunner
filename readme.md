### This project was made by me as the end of 10th grade assembly project. It was written purely with x86asm.

you can either download the exe and run it via a DOS emulator (I recommend DOSBox; dont forget to set cycles=max for good fps!) or compile it yourself with TASM.
The mp4 file is a short video showing the program in action.

For Hebrew speakers: I highly suggest reading the full documantation! Some technical problems (such as the lack of floating point) and my work arounds are described there!

controls:
w, s: move to the direction you are looking at or away from it
a, d: rotate left or right without moving
r, t: switch between first person view and top down view
q: quit
